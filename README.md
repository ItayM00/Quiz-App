# Quiz App

## Overview
This is a simple quiz app built using Python with a login and registration system, utilizing a local JSON file for user data. The app fetches quiz questions from an API and provides a user-friendly interface built with custom tkinter. Users can register, log in, and participate in quizzes based on category and difficulty fetched questions.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in with their credentials. Data is stored in a local JSON file.
- **Quiz Interface:** The app displays questions fetched from an external API.
- **Custom Tkinter UI:** The app uses custom tkinter for a clean, modern interface.
